# AI-Powered Product Recommendation Chatbot

An interactive, AI-driven product recommendation chatbot built using Flask, LangChain, OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, and FAISS for semantic product retrieval. Users can ask natural language queries to explore products and receive personalized recommendations.

---

## Features

- Query products using natural language (e.g., "Show me red jackets")
- Integrates OpenAI LLMs for intelligent fallback responses
- Recommends similar products based on category and content
- CSV-based product database with dynamic loading
- Chat-based UI built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript
- Memory-based state management using LangGraph
- Semantic search using FAISS and OpenAI embeddings

## Product CSV Format

Your `products.csv` file should contain the following columns:

| title        | description       | category   | price | color | image_path         |
|--------------|-------------------|------------|-------|--------|---------------------|
| Red Jacket   | Warm winter wear  | Jackets    | 1200  | Red    | /static/images/1.jpg |

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/product-recommendation-chatbot.git
cd product-recommendation-chatbot
````

### 2. (Optional) Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Your OpenAI API Key

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 5. Run the Flask App

```bash
python app.py
```

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint    | Description                          |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| GET    | `/products` | Returns a list of all product titles |
| POST   | `/product`  | Accepts a JSON body with a query     |

**Example POST Request**:

```json
{
  "query": "Show me black t-shirts"
}
```

---

## How It Works

1. Query is analyzed and preprocessed.
2. Exact or partial title matches are searched from the CSV.
3. Similar items are suggested using category-based filtering.
4. If no match found, semantic retrieval is performed using FAISS.
5. If still unresolved, the query is passed to OpenAI's LLM for a natural language response.

---

## Future Improvements

* Integrate a live database instead of CSV (e.g., MongoDB)
* Add voice input and speech synthesis
* Implement user authentication and personalization
* Use LangChain agents for better query handling
* Host on cloud platforms with CI/CD pipeline
